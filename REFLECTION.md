## Can I explain what my code does?
Yes, in its entirety. at the top of index.html, lang=en specifies that the webpage will be in english, charset=utf-8 sets the encoding to UTF-8, the most commonly used encoding on the internet. the body tag, which begins after the head tag, represents the start and end of the content of the webpage. After this, the header, section and footer tags are used to represent the introductory portion of the page, primary sections, and the end of the page, respectively. Nested in these tags are an assortment of other tags used to dictate the size of headers, content text, hyperlinks and to insert images and SVGs. an important tag to note are the H1-9 tags, which screen readers utilize to understand the hierarchy of content, and in some cases, summarize webpages.

## What was my coding process?
My process was to first create the "skeleton" of the page, by writing in all of my tags before adding content. I added my header, sections and footers first, and then utilized other tags within those ones as I saw fit. When I was unsure of certain tags or attributes, I checked HTML documentation to verify.

## What challenges did I have?
Overall I didn't face too many challenges, but I did forget which tags to use inside of my a tags for hyperlinks, so I checked documentation to make sure I was using the right tags for the right reasons. One larger issue I had was my uncertainty of how the aria-labelledby tag worked. I had to do some research, and then found out how it was meant to be used so I could employ it properly.

## What would I do differently now?
At the moment I don't believe I would do too much differently. If you asked me again when I had some more knowledge, I would probably say that I would go back and add style using CSS, or potentially be more efficient in how I formatted/wrote my code so that I wouldn't have to go back and change anything.
